# Smartwatch-Project-bare-metal-

# NOTE: This is one of the side projects I did in early years. The whole project relies on Visual Studio Code to build. I would clean it up and make it more professional in the future.

This is the bare-metal version. Another version with FreeRTOS can be found in a different repository.

This is the code for my simple smartwatch project. The main focus was the firmware system. A list of features of this project is given below. 

Microprocessor: ARM Cortex-M4F  

Key accessories: an LCD, an external RTC, a pulse sensor (for measuring heart rate) and an inertia measurement unit.  

OS: bare-metal system & FreeRTOS (i.e. two versions of the same project)
